# STAR Video Super Resolution - ComfyUI Node

A ComfyUI custom node wrapper for [STAR (Spatial-Temporal Augmentation with Text-to-Video Models for Real-World Video Super-Resolution)](https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/STAR), enabling high-quality video upscaling with AI-powered super-resolution.

## Overview

This node provides an easy-to-use interface for the STAR video super-resolution model within ComfyUI. STAR can upscale low-resolution videos by 2x-4x while preserving and enhancing details, with specialized models for light and heavy degradation scenarios.

## Features

- **Two Degradation Models**: Choose between Light and Heavy degradation models optimized for different video quality levels
- **Flexible Upscaling**: Support for 2x, 3x, and 4x upscaling factors
- **Text Prompting**: Guide the enhancement with text descriptions
- **Advanced Sampling**: Multiple samplers (heun, dpmpp_2m_sde) and solver modes
- **Automatic Model Download**: Models are automatically downloaded from Hugging Face Hub on first use
- **ComfyUI Integration**: Seamless integration with ComfyUI workflows

## Installation

1. Navigate to your ComfyUI custom nodes directory:
```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes/
```

2. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/STARVSRWrapper.git
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd STARVSRWrapper
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Restart ComfyUI

## Usage

1. In ComfyUI, find the node under **video/upscaling** → **STAR Video Super Resolution**
2. Connect your video frames (as IMAGE tensors) to the input
3. Configure the parameters:
   - **Model**: Choose "Light Degradation" or "Heavy Degradation"
   - **Prompt**: Describe the desired output (e.g., "a high quality video")
   - **Upscale**: Select upscaling factor (2-4x)
   - **Steps**: Number of denoising steps (15-50 recommended)
   - **CFG**: Guidance scale (7.5 default)
   - **Sampler**: Choose sampling method
   - **Max Chunk Length**: For long videos, process in chunks (32 default)
4. The node outputs upscaled video frames

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch with CUDA support
- xformers (CUDA13 is not working)
- ComfyUI
- See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for full dependencies

## Models

Models are automatically downloaded from the [SherryX/STAR](https://huggingface.co/SherryX/STAR) Hugging Face repository:
- **Light Degradation**: `I2VGen-XL-based/light_deg.pt`
- **Heavy Degradation**: `I2VGen-XL-based/heavy_deg.pt`

Downloaded models are cached in `./models/STAR/` directory.

### Third-Party Components

This wrapper also uses:
- Color correction adapted from [sd-webui-stablesr](https://github.com/pkuliyi2015/sd-webui-stablesr) by Li Yi
- Stable Video Diffusion VAE from [Stability AI](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-video-diffusion-img2vid)
- OpenCLIP text encoder

## License

This wrapper follows the license of the original STAR project. Please refer to the [original repository](https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/STAR) for licensing details.

## Troubleshooting

### CUDA Out of Memory
- Reduce `max_chunk_len` to process fewer frames at once
- Lower the upscale factor
- Process shorter video segments

### Model Download Issues
- Ensure you have internet connection for first-time model download
- Check Hugging Face Hub accessibility
- Models are ~2-3GB each, ensure sufficient disk space

### Color Artifacts
- The node automatically applies AdaIN color correction
- Try adjusting the prompt for better color guidance
- Experiment with different CFG values

## Contributing
